# MTCNN Light Face Detection and Evaluation

This repository contains MTCNN implementation with no framework. Most of the source code is adapted from [MTCNN Light](https://github.com/AlphaQi/MTCNN-light) and [MTCNN Light Self Adaption](https://github.com/samylee/mtcnn_light_self_adaption). It is implemented in core C++ with OpenCV and openblas. Advandages of this implementations are 1. easy to use, 2. no deep learning framework need, 3. real time runtime performance in CPU.  

### 1. Usage

At first you need to install OpenCV2.0.x+, and openblas. 

```
git clone https://github.com/ghimiredhikura/MTCNN-light-face-detection.git
cd MTCNN-light-face-detection/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
make ./mtcnn-light
```

### 2. Evaluation results in benchmark datasets
